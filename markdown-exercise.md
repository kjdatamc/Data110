## You Should Get a Library Card!
![Image of an MCPL Library Card](https://github.com/kjdatamc/Data110/blob/120c53ba38612c091b91170cd894bfb190b979ea/mcpl_card.jpg)
### How to get a Library Card
Apply in person at any [MCPL branch](https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/library/branches/index.html "Find a branch near you") or [online](https://montgomerycountymd.gov/library/services/card.html "Apply online").[^1] Library cards are free for Montgomery County residents and only $10 per year for non-residents. You must be at least 13 years old to get a library card.
[^1]: Certain types of accounts (eg. Nonresident and Household) require in person initial registration.

All applicants must bring a [Photo ID and Proof of Address](https://montgomerycountymd.gov/library/services/ask-a-librarian.html#section2 "Learn what forms of ID and Proof of Address are accepted")

#### Additional requirements for certain specialty accounts:
- **Household**: All members of the household must be present at the time of registration
- **Nonresidents of Montgomery County**: $10 fee (paid at the time of registration and annually thereafter)
- **Educators**: Letter on the school's letterhead indicating your employment OR the State's letter of approval of your home schooling
- **Business or Institution**: Letter on company letterhead authorizing the card for business purposes and stating the name of the person responsible if problems arise.

### Types of Library Card Accounts
- **Regular Accounts**: For individual use of all library collections and services.
- **Digital Library Card**: A full-service library card, which will allow access to all library collections and services that are available to a Regular account.[^2]
- **Household Accounts**: For all members of a household living at the same address to share one library card barcode number.
- **Nonresident Accounts**: For those who do not meet the residency requirements for a free card.
- **Homebound Accounts**: For users of MCPL's Books @ Home Service.
- **Educator Accounts**: For daycare providers, home schoolteachers, and preschool and elementary school teachers for classroom use only.
  - You will receive an extended 9-week non-renewable loan.[^3]
- **Business/Institution Accounts**: For businesses or institutions, such as nursing homes, nonprofits, or schools, to be used by employees.
  - Responsibility for fines lies with the business and not with an individual.
[^2]: Digital cards that were issued before 5/28/24 have access to online resources only, but can be converted to Regular accounts by bringing photo ID and proof of address to any MCPL branch.
[^3]: You may have both an educator card and a regular card.
